## I. Core Energetic and Informational Dynamics

This section explores the fundamental aspects of energy and information, focusing on efficiency, complexity, and environmental interaction.

### I.1. Primary Energy Transformation & Efficiency [Text]
**Question:** Describe the primary forms of energy involved and rigorously analyze how the system *itself* transforms energy to achieve functional behavior.  Assess the *efficiency* of the energy transformation and the system's energy requirements for operation. Detail the confirmed physical/chemical mechanisms of this transformation within the material and their energetic implications.

### I.2. Material-Based Memory: Encoding, Storage, and Dynamics [Text]
**Question:**  Critically evaluate the *material basis* of memory within the system, beyond transient states. Detail how information, relevant to material intelligence, is encoded and stored *physically* within the material's structure or composition. Analyze the *long-term stability*, *volatility*, and *retention time* of this material-based memory. How does this "material memory" dynamically influence system behavior and future actions, moving beyond static storage?

### I.3. Local, Non-linear Computation and Information Processing [Text]
**Question:** Describe and analyze the presence of *local, material-based computation*. Does the material perform non-linear, analog computation through its physical/chemical properties, without external digital units? How sophisticated are these computational primitives, going beyond simple threshold switching? How are these computations *distributed* across the material, and how efficiently do they process information for functions relevant to material intelligence?

### I.4. Dynamic and Multi-Modal Environmental Coupling [Text]
**Question:** How sophisticated and versatile is the material's coupling with the external environment? Does the system exhibit *active sensing* and interpretation of *diverse* environmental cues, beyond a single stimulus type?  How does the material *dynamically* respond and adapt to *changing* and *complex* environmental contexts? Analyze the *multi-modal* nature of the material's environmental interactions and coupling mechanisms.

## II. Self-Organization, Feedback, and Control

This section evaluates the system's organizational complexity, self-regulation, and the presence of feedback loops that enable autonomous behavior.

### II.1. Hierarchical Modularity and Functional Differentiation [Text]
**Question:** Evaluate the *complexity and functional relevance* of hierarchical and modular organization within the material.  Does the system exhibit a *functional hierarchy* with nested modules performing distinct yet interdependent roles? How does functional differentiation *enhance* the system's overall capabilities and emergent behaviors relevant to material intelligence? How does modularity contribute to scalability, robustness, or functional versatility?

### II.2. Local Feedback and Self-Regulation [Text]
**Question:** Analyze the presence, nature, and *complexity* of *local feedback loops* and self-regulatory mechanisms *inherent to the material*.  How do these *internal* feedback loops enable the system to autonomously control and regulate its behavior without external intervention? Is there evidence of *non-linear*, *dynamic*, and *hierarchical feedback loops* contributing to sophisticated self-regulation and emergent intelligence? Critically assess if self-regulation is truly material-based, or reliant on external control elements.

## III. Adaptability, Learning, and Emergence

This section assesses the system's capacity for adaptation, learning, and the nature of emergent behaviors.

### III.1. Active Adaptability, Responsiveness to Change, and Learning [Text]
**Question:** Critically evaluate the *nature and extent* of the material's adaptability and responsiveness to change. Does the system exhibit *active adaptation* and *self-improvement*, going beyond simple responsivity or pre-programmed reactions? Is there evidence of *learning* from past interactions or experiences, leading to optimized performance or novel behaviors? How does the material *autonomously* adapt its internal parameters or operational strategies in response to changing conditions?

### III.2. Temporal Dependence and Memory-Driven Functionality [Text]
**Question:** Analyze how temporal dependence is *functionally integrated* into the material's operation. Does the system exhibit behaviors that are *intrinsically time-dependent*, beyond simple rate limitations? How does the system leverage temporal dynamics and material-based memory to perform functions relevant to intelligence, such as anticipation, planning, or decision-making over time? Critically assess if temporal dependence contributes to more complex, non-linear responses and richer functionalities.

### III.3. Novelty, Unpredictability, and Functional Significance of Emergent Behaviors [Text]
**Question:** Critically assess the *novelty*, *unpredictability*, and *functional significance* of the observed macroscopic behaviors. Do the behaviors go significantly beyond pre-programmed routines, simple feedback control, or linear stimulus-response? Are the emergent functionalities relevant to real-world problem-solving, adaptation, or other hallmarks of intelligence? To what extent does the system exhibit truly *unexpected* and surprising behaviors that challenge pre-conceived notions of material functionality?
