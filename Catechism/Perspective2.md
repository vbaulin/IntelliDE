# Abstract

The field of “material intelligence” often seeks inspiration from the intricate behaviours of biological systems. Current designs rely largely on materials that exhibit a stimulus-response with embedded sensors and actuators, but do not reach beyond this for a robustly intelligent behaviour. These often perform a task designed externally rather than performing complex feedback, dynamic adaptation, and learning seen in truly biological autonomous agents. We argue for a need to shift focus toward self-organizing architectures coupled with physics-based minimal model implementations that harness far-from-equilibrium conditions and information theoretic control. This is illustrated by exploring several disparate but significant cases from material physics and biology that have promise of implementation into future “truly” intelligent material architectures, and to create self organized matter, rather than having human set architectures and behaviors. Our analysis highlights fundamental constraints on how these minimal units can be integrated for performing higher-order intelligent behavior in the future and moves beyond a simplified and traditional cause and effect models based in passive materials.

# 1. Introduction

The goal to produce materials that can act intelligently based on external or internal changes, that we define as material intelligence, has become the central drive in the design of next generation smart materials \cite{Physical Constraints in Intracellular Signaling, Self-healing materials: a review}. Modern methods in soft robotics (such as multi-legged magnetically propelled robot) use local coupling to control motility \cite{A bioinspired multilegged soft millirobot}, microfluidics (for microswimmers propulsion) \cite{Active colloids: Progress and challenges, Microcapsule-Containing Self-Reporting Polymers} or polymer film technology (for morphing structure), \cite{Dynamic morphological transformations in soft architected materials via buckling instability, The memorizing capacity of polymers}, and microelectronic sensing/memory devices \cite{A molecular neuromorphic network device, A nanopore interface for higher bandwidth DNA computing, A synthetic protein-level neural network, Memory inception and preservation in slime moulds, Fully hardware-implemented memristor convolutional neural network}.

While existing implementations such as robotic systems with active polymers or memristor arrays can indeed show some form of decision, actuation or memory capabilities, their reliance on central programming, specific sensory inputs and low internal complexity, separates them drastically from any system that would be perceived to exhibit cognition or intelligence, as those terms are normally understood within cognitive science and biology. Instead we should emphasize a truly self regulated architecture with multiple, local, self organizing components instead of trying to combine properties into one single material with all aspects, such as external sensors and central computations.

The core theme of these works emphasize, material responsivity (where a set property, responds predictably and precisely to input parameters as a way of processing of information) rather than adaptation. Examples include, responsive shape changes to an electric field, and the storage of information based on phase change of components under a thermal change. In fact these systems respond passively, but they are controlled or set in action via an external influence that defines parameters or triggers for such response. Although these advances are relevant, and very promising as they build knowledge, they fall short of true intelligent behaviour because (1) they lack local computation beyond threshold switching; (2) they require carefully tuned pre-defined geometries (rather than flexible self organization); (3) often rely on external controllers or human oversight that dictates system parameters without any form of self-improvement and autonomy. It should also be noted that systems with embedded memory perform a record of past events with a specific response in such designed environment but does not reflect an action beyond these previously described designs with no integration with any other new or existing environment factors during operation.

These observations highlight a crucial paradigm that requires addressing if real artificial intelligent systems are to be created via materials based architectures. This approach suggests to shift focus away from purely material responsivity (one property-one function) and instead, consider materials in a more dynamical setting where (1) external environment plays a role to create information, and where (2) there should exist dynamic local feedback mechanism as internal property, and finally (3) that information that flows into (or across) the system modulates the future behaviour based on this feedback without needing a centralized processing unit nor extensive computing.

In short, and most important for a real physical implementation, any minimal “intelligent material” must rely on a close-knit, non linear feedback loops which generate some kind of active system in a state that depends also on its current activity/performance, i.e. that they display behaviours which are defined at each step according to prior steps rather than predetermined paths only. Therefore, our focus based on prior knowledge is that is not enough to improve current “smart materials”, which only offer sensors with some form of responsivity to stimuli, or new memristive and other “smart” electronic components; rather a new physical framework is needed based on memory as time evolving components rather than just storage, local signal feedback without a central controller and also that there should be a degree of spatial self-organization and integration, which goes beyond linear arrangement of functional elements. It is only the simultaneous integration of these, rather than by selecting some features while not others, that these will lead the route to self-regulating dynamic systems as a novel paradigm in material science for realizing an ‘intelligence of matter’ and not its physical embodiment.

Specifically we highlight some critical limitations of previously introduced technologies which highlight the path for creating more advanced materials:

a. **Lack of long-term time dependent local memory:** In memristive based materials, for example while memristance provides non volatile “memory” via ionic or electronic charge carrier changes in a local nanoscale area, a form of ‘digital’ state, is achieved but this is done with externally designed time step pulses and a control unit, which is not truly distributed or organic. A better understanding, or even integration with time dependent behavior of polymeric structure to create long-term memory by phase transitions as well as mechanical deformations can have a better analogy with biological or soft matter systems by using different time constant as building block for computation. The ideal system does not use such an “instant” read-out of information by any digitalized sensors as well but does require to generate a signal itself. As such a long term memory is coupled to actuation and internal signal propagation mechanism and not based on digital memory.

b. **Absence of a local feedback and information processing loops:** The most notable feature missing in current intelligent-like devices, is the ability to use locally available data (that may represent history or current state) for self-adaptation of future performance by implementing an autonomous or minimal computing component. External programming of parameters should not be required and the system itself should evolve with each cycle without intervention. Local feedback loops and internal signal processing using non-digital computation may alleviate this in some context (for example non linear and stochastic physical processes can easily emulate logical operators with analog behaviours), as they do represent fundamental components of biological systems, especially, self-sensing-feedback (or bioenergetic) systems. By including local computational rules the design complexity would be reduced as there would be minimal dependence on complex externally driven circuits and complex computation routines by digital control, making their system behaviour more “physical” rather that software defined. However they are usually designed to reach a given value which is previously predetermined rather than a set point that varies depending on the input conditions. These can create more complex and adaptive responses from physical, distributed and interconnected network that should go beyond static pre designed patterns, such as current “robotic materials”, or static metamaterials and focus also on self regulating feedback loops, as observed in biological self assembly or molecular machines,

c. **Lack of multi stimuli response by modular material coupling.** Different functionalities are usually tied to the chosen materials of that element and its properties, making their versatility limited and requiring multiple, distinct designs and material choices to achieve new functions, with additional efforts related to components compatibility. Materials should, for example, perform mechano-electrical transduction and generate output light, or mechanical or acoustical actuation in one place while sensing chemicals in another location and changing morphology or composition. Therefore this integration of multiple different and non overlapping characteristics into a single system, can greatly increase functional performance.

In short, the development of a new area in smart, functional or cognitive material requires us to shift from the creation of complex machines made from complex architectures toward the production of responsive structures with an ability for spontaneous, active changes in its behaviour that result from a synergistic set of parameters instead of individual contributions. Instead of seeing a soft material simply a body, an encapsulation method for a set of predefined responses based on specific external controls or stimuli, or a simple way to create a mechanical actuation that we can control from the exterior via an external electric or magnetic field we can start exploring their inherent characteristics by implementing all functionalities to work synergistically to create a smart behavior that emerges out of an internal material property and physics and not from pre-determined programs that limits its potential functionality. These designs could represent important milestone toward the new era of bio-inspired self organizing and active intelligent material development which operate at fundamental different way compared to present soft robots and intelligent materials and their components. It may offer for high integration in functional multi-task materials which also take the benefits of scalability from self assembly while creating materials with robust local operation due to their autonomous, decentralized operations, without the need of complex design or pre-defined fabrication protocols with precise structural control or time-sequences of externally controlled actuation which is typically observed in current generation materials design approaches.

# 2. Towards minimal models of material intelligence

The current design paradigms in “material intelligence” are built, as described in the previous section, by means of specific physical implementations and targeted behaviors, with only a few properties and functionalities being realized at each attempt. We lack unifying architectures, especially for integrating sensing and action, without complex controllers that only operate outside of a material structure, preventing them from functioning as a truly autonomous system and exhibiting properties beyond what they were specifically designed for. As such they are reactive rather than actively exploring the physical environment and they lack “self” based agency which is a hallmark of cognition in higher living forms. These architectures are generally designed to act passively to changes that occur only at the physical locations (such as crack) of their sensors.

Based on the limitations of current approaches \cite{lu_bioinspired_2018,tanaka_molecular_2018,Active Inference Demonstrated with Artificial Spin Ice, Active machine learning model for the dynamic simulation and growth mechanisms of carbon on metal surface, Active colloids: Progress and challenges, Mechanical metamaterials and beyond}, future designs for truly intelligent materials will require abandoning strategies focused purely on static structures or externally preprogrammed mechanisms, and moving towards strategies which generate autonomous local action without long-range connectivity. In order to develop cognizant matter, the material response needs to rely on locally acting elements that exhibit multi-functionalities, self-organization, and are able to couple internal dynamics with their environment. Such intelligent behavior relies on following core interacting mechanisms at all scales from local response up to global change of material organization, which represents a step from our understanding on how smart materials or smart robots work so far and beyond typical stimulus-response behavior and fixed, predefined actions

Intelligent Soft Matter implies radical new way of using material, not as substrates, not as sensors or simply as actuators, not a memory device or logic gates alone, but as an integrated and inseparable system to act autonomously by itself according to the design rules. New models must also encompass an intrinsic memory that can influence its further response over long periods, not limited by immediate physical signals or only to current electrical charges (which always leads to very short timescale properties as its decay or discharge rates limits device memory). Such minimal design must emphasize non-linear and dynamic capabilities that go beyond simple threshold type behaviour, but allowing local computations. Therefore the materials needs not only to change to stimuli (as they do already) but also learn and use past information to achieve specific purposes that requires a more complete new material physics which can address how physics may support or create novel, emergent form of intelligent materials, different from anything currently known with a capability to reproduce and potentially expand by self made organization that is not purely limited by our external interventions but follows also an intrinsic tendency.

Here, we propose four inter-connected characteristics that any intelligent material should consider for design:

Local interaction, Local self-memory, Local low power computation and Distributed sensing/actuation elements, all tightly integrated through local rules.

## 2.1 Locally Integrated and Self-Modifying Units (for Embodied Cognition):

Intelligent matter designed system may need to incorporate local interactions among components, but avoid the need for any global communication for specific responses. Any form of control over single elements should be performed in a physically limited volume and only via local coupling.

In future of material design we need design rules of micro or nanoscale systems where material responds to the immediate local information without relying on long range signal transmission, processing that should rely on material structure, instead of separated feedback controls which, by default, creates limitations.

A strategy of distributed local component interactions will then provide means to have functional elements operating mostly on local information only \cite{Acoustic signaling enables collective perception, Reconfigurable Large-Scale Pattern Formation Driven by Topological Defect Separation}. These locally interactive functional building blocks should perform their tasks and provide local output responses. To achieve such highly flexible designs, materials should also be able to generate or locally sense energy fluxes, chemical gradients, electromagnetic potentials, or any other stimulus locally. A proper design should allow such small changes in a locally responding micro unit, to result into macro-scale behaviour via mechanical interaction, chemical pathways, light and other forms of energy fluxes across the entire structure. Moreover, internal coupling rules among such minimal units are equally important. By avoiding predefined connections, a dynamic network will emerge which will enhance functional properties of single elements.
Specifically, instead of just sensing temperature changes that lead to a set of deformations, new designs should implement feedback to change the type of thermal responsivity by measuring previous history, or generate light signals which are proportional not only the environmental parameters but the past states of material parameters such as light level using locally existing components, effectively generating the equivalent to analog data processing, and memory \cite{Self-healing materials: a review, Thermodynamics of Information Processing in Sensory Adaptation,Active Inference Demonstrated with Artificial Spin Ice, A synthetic protein-level neural network in mammalian cells, A molecular neuromorphic network device consisting of single-walled carbon nanotubes complexed with polyoxometalate}.

For example, consider a composite that swells based on the pH, but at the same time generates more acidity upon swelling, creating a closed loop response that stabilizes or oscillates, making it self aware to it own interactions and thus creating emergent behaviours which goes beyond direct interactions. Instead of requiring external electronic components, such complex system might integrate energy harvesting from a surrounding environment for an all integrated “smart device”. Another example could be a material with mechanical compliance, capable of reversible local surface deformation (swelling or contraction) based on a gradient can generate an internal pressure wave, that has local effects such as inducing change on permeability, locally activating a chemical reactions, inducing changes in electronic state, mechanical tension in different areas, change in reflectivity and so on (i.e. with an inherent functional coupling due to physics) in a series of self propagated interactions in order to reach desired output.

This calls for design paradigms beyond material responsivensness alone but a local self regulation and a non trivial physical coupling which is mostly overlooked in modern research. A core requirement of such strategy requires moving beyond thinking of different properties existing as separately designed systems, or using electrical digital architectures where all connections need to be explicitly defined, to a framework in which many properties or components are interlinked into one single functional system by inherent material behaviours with direct functional properties related to other elements without further pre programming by human design \cite{lu_bioinspired_2018,Active colloids: Progress and challenges}.

Such system must operate fully and continuously, relying on intrinsic chemical or physical mechanisms, therefore requiring design paradigm based on embodied intelligence principle at material design itself.

## 2.2 Local Self-Memory: From Static State Storage to Active Structural/Dynamical Records:

Information storage in material parameters must have explicit, time-varying dependence based on its environmental exposure and its feedback to its next responses.

The focus so far was mainly on passive, structural types of material memory such as bi-stable states, shape memory etc, or electrical memory at microscopic level such as charge at nano junctions that create resistive behaviours. While important, that approach lacks a long range memory encoding method which integrates current interactions to future behavior and to change itself (rather than being changed) to perform action efficiently or with some predictability. For instance systems using short time range responses such as piezo-electrically activated devices, mechanical switches or transient electronic current propagation are too limited for a wide range of functional abilities needed for a high level cognitive operation \cite{Mechanical metamaterials and beyond, A molecular neuromorphic network device consisting of single-walled carbon nanotubes complexed with polyoxometalate}.

Instead, real systems for a truly smart behavior, may need to rely on active non-equilibrium mechanisms for a memory with long retention times, which relies on feedback-induced physical structural change (morphing). Therefore materials must use physical or chemical memory with multi stable state which allow storage for later time actions. This storage, for higher order intelligence implementation, should require ability to change or be selectively modified according to a stimuli or set of inputs, without using pre defined steps by design, but rather in form of new interactions among functional parts or molecules. Furthermore, we should shift our view of using physical memory only for a past event recording or memory, by considering also how memory can predict (with the model parameters stored being active) or guide system dynamics. These concepts can also involve systems using molecular gradients with an ability to “retain information” on gradients which act as temporal markers that allow the material to exhibit new functionalities which were absent before the gradients being present, much like morphogenesis in living systems. The challenge is to couple this structural memory to action so that a self learning architecture can emerge.

To get beyond such restrictions, a material should incorporate some features for maintaining time dependence, using for example chain entanglement in polymers which slow diffusion effects, or local crystallization or self assembly effects that persist as long as they are not interrupted by another stimuli, and where those new forms of spatial/time dependent memory are coupled and responsible for functional actions or decision at a larger scale using local interplays or chemical/mechanical processes \cite{Thermodynamics of Information Processing in Sensory Adaptation, Active Inference Demonstrated with Artificial Spin Ice}. Specifically, rather than just providing an electrical or optical signal for encoding (which might easily decay unless new energy source or an externally implemented power system acts), real memory should be a mechanism where information is encoded on physical structure as an internal degree of freedom that alters material output based on prior history of interactions via different material structural features. The memory also should include a form of temporal coding such that the history can alter future processing. Also, any truly functional model should move from using “static memory of states” that were imprinted earlier by some fabrication process, or an “short term volatile” memristor type memory based on electrical currents alone and which have some specific set of time constant or charge retention time, into self assembled (dynamic) and physically recorded internal parameters (stress, composition, morphology and others) that respond or are altered due to external conditions (i.e mechanical input, thermal or photochemical activity) which represents a way to perform long term storage \cite{Self-healing materials: a review, The memorizing capacity of polymers}. The main idea is that the material should "retain” the signal or response in a material property and use it at a latter time. This allows to create the concept of learning, adaptation, by reading/ writing (changing a signal/property). For example instead of short living free charges used for microelectronics components \cite{Active machine learning model for the dynamic simulation, Artificial Sensory Memory}, memory units could be constructed from more permanent configurations. We might use local stress induced changes of optical properties within material which are generated upon force actuation at a particular position, thus both sensing force location while recording deformation state at that position to modulate action later through the material \cite{Dynamic morphological transformations in soft architected materials via buckling instability encoded heterogeneous magnetization}, where such a state change should persist as long as is needed to complete action based on prior experience in previous interactions of a given type of stimuli (or a specific action-induced response at a particular location or state).

Therefore, not only storing a signal that the system received, but, more specifically storing memory of physical changes related with it, will increase robustness for future more complex intelligent functions and it is part of the framework of the definition for cognizant matter that has memory integrated with action at the material level.

## 2.3 Local Low-Power Distributed Computation with Local Coupling and Non Linear Responses (for self-sustaining dynamics):

It is key that the individual elements, beyond memory, should exhibit a capacity for local, distributed analogue calculation without relying on external centralized controllers and that local operations of small elements result in collective emergent behaviors. These individual parts of a truly self-regulating material must integrate internal dynamics (a clock, which can define timescale), the local sensing mechanism and a set of tunable responses.

Specifically this points to creation of non linear, multi-state systems which are coupled among each other where all those features emerge out of simple rule systems with localized interactions, in analogy to what happens with biological networks with complex feedbacks and multiple amplification steps and complex decision makings, relying, ultimately on small number of components and mechanisms.

In this case the system’s computational properties should be a result of their own mechanical properties, rather than some electrical read out or software controlled logic or an additional controller, by coupling their sensing directly to their output using minimal external elements (such as optical signal to measure a chemical or electrical output). The main path towards true intelligent system at materials level is that components (especially memory or output elements) should directly react to a given set of rules as physical outputs instead of relying only in mathematical computation based on digital or analogue electronics where feedback happens in post processing \cite{Active machine learning model for the dynamic simulation, Active Inference Demonstrated with Artificial Spin Ice, An Intelligent Material with Chemical Pathway Networks}. Any component of an intelligent system must be built by following minimization of thermodynamic (or other physical form of a ‘cost’ functional) parameters so the system has an implicit preference toward more effective configurations that use minimal amount of free energy per unit task completion.

Such implementation requires also going beyond traditional transistor logic-based architectures for complex operations, such as those performed by digital components with Boolean logic to develop new types of material computation using dynamic interactions based on analogue properties that arise as a result of their material and local design features \cite{Acoustic signaling enables collective perception, Self-healing materials: a review, Mechanical metamaterials and beyond}.

To that end systems should minimize energy expenditure and be designed with intrinsic response characteristics (and dynamic behaviors). Specifically for this an ideal route would involve to move from discrete switches which perform digital functions with an explicit action that produces on/off output, and, instead create an environment for physical interactions (using coupled physical systems with continuous variation) as basic component with a focus on complex temporal and spatial behaviour based analog operations (rather than digital) for a given problem. Moreover, the materials used as base components, should respond at an analog format to enable such processing, for example a system that is responding to continuous change of pressure should not operate through discrete threshold response, or a system that senses chemical gradients should not do it with electrical switching mechanism only, to avoid loss of information during its processing step \cite{Thermodynamics of Information Processing in Sensory Adaptation, Active machine learning model for the dynamic simulation and growth mechanisms of carbon on metal surface}. Furthermore we should exploit known material physical parameters that offer low energy solutions.
For example to obtain temporal control on an action (such as cargo delivery) an electrical voltage is mostly implemented, as a “on and off switch" or by pre designing time control through RC constants, however new routes could focus on mechanical changes in which slow dynamic deformation are part of output response itself. That will convert current linear implementation into a highly dynamic non linear output from same material structure and properties as well as its interactions with its environment by utilizing physics.
Such concepts which build on analog information processing should go beyond standard silicon based electronics by relying on “material as a component”, so by encoding processing at their basic design.

It will be beneficial for this to exploit inherent nonlinearities of chemical or physical phenomena or thresholds behaviours. In general all the computations should be carried by local feedback by exploiting the physical medium to process its dynamics using the material as the actual computing system.

## 2.4 Feedback Loops based on Thermodynamic Gradients with Embodied Sensing-Action Mechanisms For Adaptive Information Processing:

Traditional information theory ignores thermodynamics (as data has no physical state or properties), whereas a truly functioning active system will be constrained by such principles.

A major drawback in almost all of the previous studied materials is a lack of “self”. There is limited or null capacity for systems to change, learn and refine based on prior input and current states; systems react predictably, in a closed and predefined fashion. Real “cognizant systems” should instead react by making use of the their interactions with an immediate environment based not only on direct sensory or chemical cues but also by their previous response history that can influence and modify the behaviour of the same material in different times, a form of an internally set memory that modulates not only output parameters of each functional units (as often explored) but its ability to choose one response over another by making connections and also with dynamic and non linear effects among a local collection of components\cite{Active Inference as a theory of sentient behavior}. The parameters must be updated automatically, via minimal computations but still requiring that information flows into a given node in a distributed network using locally and non linear control. That information then modifies material proprieties for an ongoing self improvement. Such dynamic behaviours requires a non linear feedback to create an implicit link between past events with their impact for the next operation of the device. To generate these type of behaviours we can start building the system on principles that emulate reinforcement learning methods where memory systems respond, depending on parameters derived from their environment while local physics guide this type of changes towards lower free energy, maximizing material efficiency without complex external interventions as was the case with all previous examples of adaptive material response\cite{Artificial Sensory Memory,A molecular neuromorphic network device consisting of single-walled carbon nanotubes complexed with polyoxometalate, Active machine learning model for the dynamic simulation}. That can be implemented in any of the discussed cases in several previous paragraphs where external control and simple actions are used as a benchmark and may present a first pathway that should have an initial external set up parameters for start action.

The critical feature for having a high degree of what we might term ‘material intelligence’ will be also on system capabilities to choose among a repertoire of actions by combining prior experiences with external environmental stimuli, to actively modulate system response during implementation that allows learning rather than passive responsivity that is mostly found in systems tested before. In summary it is not enough that a material responds to stimuli as most “smart” systems currently achieve , but to adapt, self-regulate, to perform computation while retaining a past influence via embedded non-equilibrium states.
For that, we should prioritize development of non-equilibrium systems where interactions in the system and with the environment allow adaptation on real time by modifying properties, learning from history and making decisions locally using low-power physical or chemical components with mechanisms where past internal response is a parameter which modulates the system behavior based on local observations.

**Hierarchical Implementation of these Principles:** In general system with some kind of a hierarchical component are seen to behave more effectively in terms of system’s power and robust against failures or changing environment (which implies that information exchange can not be based purely on simple 1 to 1 interactions).

In addition to these design principles it is important also to consider scalability of material manufacturing as a fundamental requirements for mass production of material and that implies: (1) simplicity of design to not requiring many material elements but rather only a minimal units that create complex behaviours through local organization. (2) it is also crucial to limit any chemical or biochemical modification to ensure simple processes, so scalable (3) all designs must have minimum or zero requirement of digital control unit for independent operation to enable lower energy implementation.

If it is all, or some of those elements are correctly identified or applied in combination we might begin to see examples of true "material intelligence” as those designs start to generate an emerging dynamic complexity of a different kind to what has been explored so far with electronic/machine learning implementation. The long range goal, though will remain creation of systems with "evolvability” that can operate in a similar fashion that living cells do.

# Beyond Simple Responsiveness, Toward Open-Ended Dynamical Adaptation

Current progress in material-based intelligence provides novel avenues towards future materials and robotics, as the basic principles behind several bio-based systems start to get understood from physics. While systems to implement sensing, action or to combine memory or learning capabilities are being continuously created or improved, a truly “intelligent material” as envisioned for future will need to combine all features such as sensory input, active components capable of self propelled motion and actions, computation within a medium and dynamic learning all at the same time. The combination must provide robustness against perturbations and an internal or self regulatory mechanism without external assistance.

In this context, minimal architecture in materials design means that functional units should be very compact, and self sustaining or with very low need for external power source, without centralized components and they should be implemented in a simple, versatile and a scalable manner, and by using simple physics to generate complex behaviors with minimal cost. A more comprehensive approach to intelligent material should involve design principles where complex higher order functions arise naturally by proper physical selection, not by human intention during creation/production, and as a result from design constraints, where a large number of similar units with a minimal local intelligence interacts by physical processes, that makes the collective behaviour and higher intelligence functions, without specific, predefined set parameters before start implementation.

The central message behind this vision is in how to construct or synthesize a material such that information about the outside world and any previous operation history, remains permanently, not only as a result of material design (as typically implemented at today’s technological settings in mechanical metamaterials or sensors), but through a material where their own dynamics creates responses which can guide other parts and create inter-dependencies in the entire systems. Furthermore to address many key limitations of present design architectures for new type of future material implementation. To do that, a series of key issues must be addressed and require an emphasis on research of the future:

1.  Development of new forms of soft matter that can exhibit local but extended response using memory as active element of their operation. Currently, memory is designed in separate parts (magnetic disk or charge based storage), while in living cells, the response comes with the memory system that also shapes a type of feedback (e.g. how many proteins or RNA to be created, how strongly are the signal pathways operating after having sensed external stimulus). As previously cited these actions are often short lived as these elements mostly retain parameters until next operation but does not change future outcome, which is preprogrammed into its logic of interaction by human designed components.
2.  Generation of new strategies for material implementation that have high capacity for sensing environmental dynamics, i.e not just to detect a single external event (e.g presence of particular molecule or temperature or a strain level), but rather, that can generate data-streams from their direct interaction and self regulation by detecting multiple parameters simultaneously from various origins (chemical/electrical/mechanical etc ) over extended periods with continuous feedback without requiring human interference or power over every operation step of such detection mechanisms. In other words how to extract or encode external world parameters by making use of minimal designed modules, by a purely passive design by an effective conversion into an ‘analogue value’ that can be part of the local processing capabilities of the designed material component.
3.  Finding new principles to enhance the level of complexity in action by designing system components (units) for complex feedback interactions with each other that result in high throughput parallel processing without bottlenecks. Those interactions that enable distributed intelligence to perform a more complex version of a computation than traditional computers, using internal interactions at a system level for information selection or pattern mapping via physical interactions and non linearities that can guide those behaviors beyond simple predefined reactions.
4.  To build materials in such a manner that internal state variables such as stress and topology becomes central parts of computing systems via physical mechanism rather than some abstract theoretical idealisations using pre-programmed operations with external computing control by digital circuits or similar software control schemes. The physics should drive all action as well as information retrieval mechanism by design with self sustained local process with limited external dependency, that would not just react or remember the last input signal but should allow to perform a more adaptive selection for system response (similar to neural or immune systems) using embedded physics/chemistry.

By meeting all these features new kind of material, exhibiting a behaviour that resembles life (self sustenance and evolvability and interaction) rather that traditional non-living systems. A system whose design would incorporate all characteristics (local responses, multi level hierarchical feedback and dynamical time dependent and long lasting physical memory combined with intrinsic non linear operations as local interaction) of this proposed framework and that we would define more clearly as “cognizant matter”. As such, if our implementation succeeds these proposed intelligent devices will lead into a new kind of material, that not just “sense” or “act”, but make selections using embodied information within its physical parameters while learning (or becoming more effective/performing better or showing new emerging functionalities that have been selected via the use) to interact in specific situations through an active feedback using local physics to its surroundings.

These next steps are far beyond currently developed methods of material intelligence as described, with main objectives for these concepts are that materials have minimal dependency with traditional electrical systems and external high power control or algorithmic calculations. As those new type of materials have memory via new design methods that enable specific patterns by encoding it into structure, geometry, composition or the internal states, rather than traditional methods by encoding these to specific hard coded control. By their self organizing nature, such materials might not be able to generate desired solutions instantly as it does by pre programmed computers and may rely also stochastic fluctuations, but the robustness that emerges out of large networks is expected to enhance the adaptation ability of these systems to many complex and unforeseen events and operational condition.
Finally a system capable of these key core capabilities (local processing using embodied physics principles, material memory linked to internal states based on non-linear dynamics, and ability of material structure for time based learning which relies mostly in passive systems), might serve as core parts to build next-generation computing that would surpass our current approaches both with power efficiency but also in levels of their cognitive performances.

These new systems are inspired by, but also transcend the limits of, current biological solutions, using similar working principles but allowing greater freedom in design that provides the creation of not only an analogue to living organisms, but even the possible genesis of previously unexplored “material-based” intelligences at nanoscale as well as macro-level physical implementations by the specific features at every point.
To that end such research and developments would enable a transition from current “smart” matter or robotics to a design paradigm of new technology based on living-like principles which we could be classifying using this analysis as an cognizant matter, and will not only perform, sense, and act upon external needs or commands or external stimuli, but through complex coupling will create an environment for those new designed entities to explore different approaches based on information and response from inside themselves without pre programming or outside control.

The practical significance lies not only on achieving higher levels of engineering complexity or simply implementing complex functionalities in new types of smart machines and materials with autonomy, adaptation and minimal use of resources and a minimal reliance on central processing but also in creating a foundation for truly emergent self organising behaviours to be coded in a physical material which can adapt and develop through use by selecting the best responses and that this can be done using the minimal energy required and that are naturally accessible, thus bypassing current problems for future sustainability using highly performing and more efficient material architecture for information technologies. Therefore this framework opens a view to potentially revolutionize the role and importance of materials in new industrial implementations and it can be a powerful concept for developing new type of future systems. This moves materials science to the direction of development that involves truly innovative methodologies, instead of mere optimisation or refinement of current methods or adding more layers of control to current type of devices and robots, as seen with most intelligent materials developed up to now which requires very precise external software based control to properly act in any real situation that may need a different response, different input range, or even unforeseen stimuli where adaptation or long term autonomous operation is necessary and may represent a future road map toward new scientific, technological and even social directions to move away from the current problems associated with high resources dependence of any information processing system by building, at least from theoretical or practical concepts (and maybe finally to physical design) the building blocks for those new type of transformative materials.

# Conclusion

The current perspective indicates that some degree of autonomy is attainable when physical rules and material’s properties are properly selected and combined. But truly advanced capabilities related to higher order cognition and memory and selective responses or pattern recognitions are yet to be achieved. The path toward those will require research that goes far beyond of the scope of our current abilities. Here a proposal was to develop all this from a combination of carefully designed minimal components instead of a monolithic implementation. Our aim was not a “strong artificial intelligence in a material sense” (which is out of bounds in scope, in terms of our current knowledge) but rather the foundation blocks that could create a way to build higher-order responses and emergent intelligent behaviours. Furthermore a true biomimetic approach must follow a path that has biological inspiration as the ultimate target that takes inspiration from nature while also not been confined by biological limits, allowing for creation of more innovative physical systems, using molecular based, macroscopic functional and adaptive behaviors with higher capabilities than biological systems themselves. We propose as a roadmap that in future design and studies we should integrate a minimal structure for implementation of material based feedback loops by means of simple, tunable units, having inherent mechanisms of memory, an ability to use internal stored information to produce some output, local computational primitives with parallel design, and finally *autonomy without need for external control*. It is in such context, with physical processes enabling more complex system behaviour with built in autonomy and self control properties , in which an truly intelligent material system can, finally emerge and pave the path toward complex devices in near future.
