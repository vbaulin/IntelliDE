## I. Core Energetic and Informational Dynamics

This section explores the fundamental ways energy and information are handled within the system.

### I.1. Primary Energy Transformation [Text]
Describe the primary forms of energy involved in the system's operation and how energy is transformed or utilized to produce functional behavior. Focus on the underlying physical/chemical processes.

### I.2. Nature of Information Encoding and Storage [Text]
Describe the physical mechanisms by which information is encoded, stored (temporally sustained states), and potentially retrieved within the material system. Avoid pre-defining "memory" and focus on how past states influence present or future behavior.

### I.3. Dynamics of Information Flow and Transformation [Text]
Describe how information (however encoded) propagates and is transformed within the system. Focus on the pathways, mechanisms of alteration, and potential integration of different informational signals.

### I.4. Influence of Environmental Context [Text]
How does the external environment (inputs, boundary conditions) influence the internal energy and information dynamics of the system? Describe the interfaces and coupling mechanisms.

## II. Organizational Principles and Relational Structures

This section explores how the system is organized and how its components relate to each other.

### II.1. Modularity and Functional Differentiation [Text]
Describe the presence and nature of distinct functional units or modules within the system. How are these units differentiated in terms of structure, function, or response characteristics?

### II.2. Nature of Coupling Between Components [Text]
Describe the mechanisms by which different components or regions of the system interact. Focus on the physical basis of these interactions (e.g., mechanical, chemical, electromagnetic). How dynamic and context-dependent are these couplings?

### II.3. Hierarchy and Levels of Organization [Text]
Describe any hierarchical organization present within the system, from the most fundamental building blocks to the emergent macroscopic behavior. How do different levels of organization interact and influence each other?

### II.4. Control and Regulatory Mechanisms [Text]
Describe any internal mechanisms that regulate the system's behavior. How are specific actions or states initiated, modulated, or terminated? Avoid assuming a central controller and focus on distributed or emergent control.

## III. Temporal Behavior and Adaptability

This section focuses on how the system changes and responds over time.

### III.1. Mechanisms of Temporal Dependence [Text]
Describe how the system's past states or experiences influence its present or future behavior. Focus on the underlying physical/chemical mechanisms responsible for this temporal dependence.

### III.2. Adaptability and Responsiveness to Change [Text]
Describe how the system responds to changes in its internal state or external environment. What mechanisms enable adaptation, learning, or the emergence of novel behaviors?

### III.3. Presence and Nature of Feedback Loops [Text]
Describe any feedback loops present within the system. Focus on how the output of one process influences its own input or the input of other processes. Is the feedback positive, negative, or more complex? How localized or distributed are these loops?

## IV. Functional Emergence and Abstraction

This section explores the emergent behaviors and potential for abstract characterization.

### IV.1. Observed Macroscopic Behaviors [Text]
Describe the key observable behaviors or functionalities exhibited by the system that might be considered "intelligent" or adaptive.

### IV.2. Underlying Mechanisms Enabling Emergent Behavior [Text]
Based on the previous sections, describe the key underlying mechanisms and organizational principles that give rise to the observed macroscopic behaviors.

### IV.3. Potential for Abstraction and Generalization [Text]
What are the most abstract principles or relationships that appear to govern the system's behavior? Can you identify any analogies to other complex systems (biological, computational, etc.)?
